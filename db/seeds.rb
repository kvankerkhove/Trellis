# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

Do not allow soil to crust before the emergence of seedlings, which takes 1â€“3 weeks, depending on temperature and moisture. If necessary, thin young seedlings to 3/4â€“2" apart, depending on root size desired. Keep weed-free by tine weeding and shallow hoeing.'
