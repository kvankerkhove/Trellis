Do not allow soil to crust before the emergence of seedlings, which takes 1â€“3 weeks, depending on temperature and moisture. If necessary, thin young seedlings to 3/4â€“2" apart, depending on root size desired. Keep weed-free by tine weeding and shallow hoeing.',

    yield_unit: 'lbs',
    watering_needs: "Early in the growing season, watering plants at the base of the plant daily in the morning. Avoid getting the leaves wet, as it can cause mold. As temperatures increase, you might need to water tomato plants twice a day. Garden tomatoes typically require 1-2 inches of water a week. Tomato plants grown in containers need more water than garden tomatoes.",
    details: "Don't start too earlyâ€”leggy, root-bound, or flowering transplants can cause stunting and reduce early production. About 5â€“6 weeks before transplanting, sow 1/4in deep in 20-row flats with 20 seeds/row, or in 200-cell trays with 1 seed/cell; lightly cover. Keep mix at 75â€“85Â°F (24â€“29Â°C) with moderate moisture. At first true leaf, pot-up to 50-cell trays or 4in pots, depending on expected transplant timing",

    watering_needs: 'Make sure they receive enough rainfall or deep watering. Drought stress can cause the roots to develop poor/spicy flavor and a tough texture. If the planting does not get one inch of rain each week, soak the soil thoroughly at least once a week. If your soil is sandy, it is important to water more often than once a week',
    details: "Sow at any time during the season, beginning in early spring. Use 2â€“3in wide bands, seeds about 3/4â€“1in apart (about 35 seeds/ft. except 10 seeds/ft. for 'Red Meat,' 'Nero Tondo,' and 'Green Luobo Improved'), 1/2in deep, rows 1' apart, or any row or bedding scheme that will eliminate unplanted ground to discourage weeds. For longer, straighter French Breakfast radishes, sow 15â€“20% more seeds per row than round radishes, 1/2 to 1 cm deeper, and do not irrigate unless absolutely necessary. Radishes are adversely affected by hot, dry weather. They remain in prime condition only a few days and should be grown rapidly with plenty of moisture to be mild, tender, and attractive",

    watering_needs: "The main care requirement for cucumbers is consistent watering. They need at least one inch of water at the base of the plant per week (or more, if temperatures are particularly high). Getting the leaves of the plant wet can cause downy mildew and mold. Inconsistent watering leads to bitter-tasting fruit.",
    details: "Sow indoors 1â€“2 seeds/cell, 3â€“4 weeks before transplanting. Keep temperature above 70Â°F (21Â°C) day and 60Â°F (16Â°C) night. Transplant 12in apart in rows 5â€“6' apart. Do not disturb roots when transplanting. If directly sowing into ground, wait until soil is warm, at least 70Â°F (21Â°C). Cucumber seeds will not germinate at a soil temperature below 50Â°F (10Â°C). Sow 2 seeds/ft., 1/2in deep, in rows 6' apart. Thin to 12in apart.",
